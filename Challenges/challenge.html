                        <h1>Goblins, bitter rivals of the Dwarves.</h1>
                        <p>Goblins are intelligent, evil, aggressive humanoid creatures <br>
                        that live in dark pits, and are the main opponent of the Dwarves</p>
                        <p>Goblins will start harassing a fortress early in its life.</p>
                        <p>Their soldiers are commonly armored with copper and iron armor,<br>
                         and armed with copper, iron and silver weapons</p>
                         <p>While aggressive, goblins are notably cowardly. Although they're <br>
                         brutal and sadistic, they will not hold the line against a superior <br>
                         force and are more than willing to sacrifice their wounded comrades <br>
                         in a badly organized retreat. Their strength generally comes from <br>
                         pure numbers, as they're usually weaker than a dwarf one-on-one</p>
                        <br><br>
